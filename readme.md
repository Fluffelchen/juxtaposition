## reverse's long-overdue golang rewrite

### why the heck whiskers?
juxtaposition was created to address numerous issues
with reverse, most notably it's reliance on external
web servers, and the fact that currently, it uses php,
which a rewrite in go has major performance gains over.
there are many other reasons why such a rewrite would be
desirable, but i'm not going to get into them here
because of many unnamed constraints.

### when will this be finished?
idk, the only major thing in the way of me getting this
finished is yamamura, the discord bot, and school.
hopefully i can take care of those the way reswitched mods
do bans, quickly and swiftly.

### planned features
	- feature parity with reverse
	- completely self-contained (no external webserver)
	- much quicker than reverse
	- code readability
