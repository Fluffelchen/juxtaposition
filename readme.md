# juxtaposition
### reverse's long-overdue golang rewrite

### why the heck whiskers?
juxtaposition was created to address numerous issues
with reverse, most notably it's reliance on an external
web servers, and the fact that currently, it uses php,
which a rewrite in go has major performance gains over

### when will this be finished?
idk, the only major thing in the way of me getting this
finished is yamamura, the discord bot, and school.
hopefully i can take care of those the way reswitched mods
do bans, quickly and swiftly.
